List of Coding Tasks and Problems in C

1. FizzBuzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

2. Palindrome Checker: Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

3. Prime Number Generator: Write a program to generate all prime numbers up to a given number N.

4. Linked List Implementation: Implement a singly linked list data structure in C with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

5. Binary Search Tree: Implement a binary search tree data structure in C and perform basic operations like insertion, deletion, and search.

6. Sorting Algorithms: Implement sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. Compare their efficiencies on different datasets.

7. Matrix Operations: Write functions to perform basic matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transpose.

8. Stack Implementation: Implement a stack data structure in C and perform operations like push, pop, and peek.

9. Queue Implementation: Implement a queue data structure in C using arrays or linked lists and perform operations like enqueue and dequeue.

10. Binary Search: Write a C program to perform a binary search on a sorted array.

11. String Manipulation: Implement functions to perform common string manipulation tasks such as string concatenation, substring extraction, and string reversal.

12. Graph Representation: Implement graph data structures (e.g., adjacency matrix, adjacency list) and basic graph algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).

13. File Handling: Write a program that reads data from a text file, manipulates it (e.g., sorting, filtering), and writes the result to another file.

14. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Practice dynamic memory allocation in C by implementing data structures like dynamic arrays or dynamic linked lists.

15. Bit Manipulation: Write programs to perform bitwise operations such as bitwise AND, OR, XOR, left shift, and right shift.

16. Heap Structure: Implement a binary heap data structure in C and perform basic operations like insertion, deletion (both min and max heap), and heapify.

17. Hash Table: Implement a hash table data structure in C with collision resolution techniques like chaining or open addressing. Include operations like insertion, deletion, and search.
